Description
-----------
With my help you can create polls and conduct them in your groups!
So you can create a poll with "/pollcreate" and start that poll in any group where i live with "/pollstart name" or "/pollstart number"
You can find all your polls and statistic for them with help of the command "/start".

All suggestions and wishes for the work of the bot write directly in the bot-chat with the command "/suggestion"
